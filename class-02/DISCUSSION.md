# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and **create a page in your reading-notes repo** that summarizes what you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Reading-notes entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Comparison of "basic" text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

## Read

* [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Read Carefully

The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal. While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL). Read through these pages carefully. ***Don't worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon.*** For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.
