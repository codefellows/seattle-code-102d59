# Power Tools

Having the right tool can make a "hard" thing suddenly much more achievable. Set yourself up for success by getting the right tools and starting to learn them.

## Setup and Documentation

Follow the [Computer Setup Guide](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/){:target="_blank"} to prepare your development machine for serious coding.

This requires carefully following instructions, and potentially interpreting esoteric error messages. Practice those detail-oriented skills! Take things slowly, and if things go wrong, don't hesitate to get help.

## Requirements

By the time you've completed the guide, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal and have each report a version number of what's installed.

- `code --version`
- `git --version`
- `node --version`
- `npm --version`
- `eslint --version`
- `tree --version`

Furthermore, the following commands will show you how you have a few key items configured

- `echo $PS1`
- `cat ~/.gitconfig`

### Stretch Goals

Now that you've got your spiffy Terminal up and running, go back through the Reading assignment, and follow along with your own version of the commands, on your computer.

### Submission Instructions

To verify that all of the above commands are working properly, run this command in your terminal: 

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefellows/setup-guide/main/configs/verify.sh | bash`

Copy and paste the results in the 'Reply' below. Help review your classmates' submissions to look for any potential errors.
