# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and **create a page in your reading-notes repo** that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

<strong style="color: green">Reminder:</strong> *all your reading-notes assignments should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember... A-C-P)*
