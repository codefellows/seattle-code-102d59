# Hand-Rolled CSS

Team up with your partner and add some styles to the structure you built from the wireframe.

## Setup and Documentation

Start by going back to the whiteboard. Recreate your wireframe, and work with your partner to identify what styles you can apply.

Utilize coordinated colors from a color-scheme web site like [Adobe's](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel){:target="_blank"}. Label your wireframe with what colors go where.

Now is a good time to develop your Google-fu. As you identify specific things you'd like to accomplish in your design, see if you can craft a google search that brings you the answer. Implement what you find, to practice writing CSS.

### Stretch Goals

Try using a few different methods of specifying your colors: Hex codes (3 or 6 digits), rgb(), hsl()... Are there any places you can tastefully tweak the opacity?

### Submission Instructions

Share your site url once again, so people can compare the before and the after. As you check out the work others did, try guessing at which tags are where!
