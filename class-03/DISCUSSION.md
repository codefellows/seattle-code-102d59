# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the lecture.  

Go through these resources, and **create a page in your reading-notes repo** that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Notes entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts

## Read

* [Git Intro](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/){:target="_blank"}
  * Read only up through the section called **"Seeing Your Remote"**.
  * Feel free to skim the "Getting Started" instructions, do not follow along with that section for now.


## Answer

1. What is Version Control?
2. What is `cloning` in Git?
3. What is the command to track and stage files?
4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

## Submission Instructions

* Share what you've learned by **copying and pasting the full text of your new rendered web page** into the 'Reply' below.
* Include the live URL of the new page below your pasted text. (*Hint: The URL of the page should begin with YOUR GitHub username, not "github.com"*)

You are invited to check out your classmates' replies and give positive feedback and words of encouragement.
