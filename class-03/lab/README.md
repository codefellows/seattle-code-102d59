# Practice with Git

Try out the workflow from the in-class workshop with another repo.

## Setup and Documentation

Clone down your reading-notes repo to your local computer, so you can do all future work in VS Code.

## Requirements

1. Continue to practice writing Markdown!
1. Review your past reading-notes entries.
    - Correct any typos
    - Fix any errors
    - Bulk up any areas that look thin
1. Build out your site structure
    - Create a new directory for your `102` notes with 8 files
    - Create a new directory for your `201` notes with 15 files
        - Each topic you've written about should have its own page
    - The home page should contain only:
        - Your introduction
        - A description of what this website is about
        - A Table of Contents
    - Use Markdown to create a link from the Table of Contents to the topic's page
    - Table of Contents should have:
        - Heading for `Code 102 Reading Notes`
            - 8 links to current and future 102 Reading notes
        - Heading for `Code 201 Reading Notes`
            - 15 links to future 201 Reading notes
1. Keep a clean git history
    - After every meaningful change, A-C-P.
    - Write commit messages that explain WHY you made your changes, not what the changes were.
