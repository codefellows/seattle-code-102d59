# Loop the Loop

## Setup and Documentation

Work from your existing code base. If it's not a git repo yet, take a minute to set it up to sync to your account on GitHub.

## Requirements

1. Add validation on one of the user inputs.
   - Keep asking until an acceptable value is entered.
2. Show an image related to your page's topic, repeated within your page.
   - Prompt the user with a relevant question for a number (e.g.: "How many cats do you want?" or "What star rating would you give, 1-5?")
   - Use a loop in your JavaScript code to show the image that many times.
   - How could you use functions to make your code more readable?

### Stretch Goals

As you display each image, show a counter next to it indicating the number of the image.

### Submission Instructions

Share a link to your deployed page, for your classmates to enjoy! Check out someone else's page, and try it out.
